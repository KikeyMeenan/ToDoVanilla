unit test:
ui components
ui services
api services

integration test:
ui routes
api routes
api -> db interaction/connection
*create a test db
*create a test data set
*clear down db and apply starting dataset on each run
*is it going to be easier to have a master test db and create new from a backup of that?
*query this data via api to test full interaction

*do we want to run this before each test set? gonna be slow but allows running in isolation
CREATE DATABASE todo_test WITH TEMPLATE todo_test_base OWNER postgres
OR
*if we do this we can run many suites in parallel
CREATE DATABASE todo_test_(testsuite) WITH TEMPLATE todo_test_base OWNER postgres
